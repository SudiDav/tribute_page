              Programmers test a program by running it and looking for bugs
              (errors). As they are identified, the programmer usually makes the
              appropriate corrections, then rechecks the program until an
              acceptably low level and severity of bugs remain. This process is
              called testing and debugging. These are important parts of every
              programmer's job. Programmers may continue to fix these problems
              throughout the life of a program. Updating, repairing, modifying,
              and expanding existing programs is sometimes called maintenance
              programming. Programmers may contribute to user guides and online
              help, or they may work with technical writers to do such work.
